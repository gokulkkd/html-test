                        We’re getting very excited to complete the launch of the RTR-Sociometrics Certificate Program.
                        We are grateful to have an incredible team of Trainers and look forward to giving you our full
                        support. In this letter, we’d like to outline opportunities for you to become highlighted as a
                        trainer, host your own training, and leverage the optional support now available to you through
                        TPN.health. As we begin publicizing the Certificate to treatment centers and clinicians, we want
                        to ensure that you are aware of your options as Trainers.

                        Option 1: Organize an In-Person Training with Support from Tian and TPN.health!
                        <br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to be entrepreneurial, here's a great option.</span>
                    </h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>1. Your Role:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 10px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                        <li>Supply the space</li>
                        <li>Set the registration fee as you see fit</li>
                        <li>Educate and engage. Provide the 2-day basic training following the RTRS protocol (level I)
                            or training to fulfill the remaining 3-days in psychodrama/sociometry (level II & III)</li>
                        <li>Collect 70% of revenue</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>2. Tian x TPN.health’s Role:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin: 10px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                        <li>CE accreditation for all major behavioral health boards, as applicable (ASWB, APA, NADAAC,
                            NBCC, NYSED, CAMFT+).</li>
                        <li>Registration page creation, attendance tracking, streamlined CE certificates, plus access to
                            pre and post-event data insights.</li>
                        <li>Marketing support: Promotional assets and co-marketing efforts to Tian’s and TPN.health’s
                            combined email lists of 170k+ clinicians. Email campaigns, TPN.health newsfeed and social
                            media shoutouts. This is exclusively for when doing RTR-S specific trainings.</li>
                        <li>30% of revenue collected by Tian/TPN.health (a minimum may apply). We designed this split to
                            be as favorable to trainers as possible to encourage you to consider this option. As long as
                            you are onboarding people from your training to the certificate path, we will be able to
                            keep this split going.</li>

                        <br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">As we share the Certificate Program with Treatment Centers, we are hearing from programs interested in bringing a trainer to their site.</span>

                        <li>Tian Dayton and Sarah Duke, Chief Development Officer at TPN.health, will meet with
                            interested organizations to connect them with trainers.</li>
                        <li>We will act as an intermediary, getting in touch to check your availability and willingness
                            to provide the training.</li>
                        <li>We negotiate a fee that works for all parties. The goal is to secure a minimum of $2,000 per
                            day, per trainer, plus travel expenses, allowing $1,500 to go to you, the Trainer, and $500 (25%) to Tian Dayton/TPN.health.</li>
                        <li>TPN.health handles CEs, attendance tracking, evaluations/certificates, and customer support.</li>

                        <li>You may facilitate RTRS trainings at facilities, or for the general public without any assistance or fees required from Tian Dayton or TPN.health.</li>
                        <li>We ask that you please hand out or email participants onboarding materials so that trainees learn how to get an RTR-S certificate if they choose to.
                            <br>• Please refer to the RTR-S Facilitator Toolkit for these materials.
                        </li>
                        <li>TPN.health’s support is completely optional. You may contact TPN.health for assistance with treatment center negotiations and CE management. Should you elect support from TPN.health, please refer to the compensation models provided above.
                            <br>• Community wide trainings where you set the ticket price: refer to the compensation model in Option 1.
                            <br>• For staff training at facilities: refer to Option 2.

                        Option 4: Host Virtual RTR-S Training on TPN.health!
                        <br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">You have the option to develop RTR-S specific virtual training to fulfill this program’s requirements with support from TPN.health</span>

                    <ul style="margin: 10px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                        <li>Up to one-third of the required psychodrama hours for levels II and III can be virtual, but they must be live and specific to RTRS, e.g., your integration of RTRS into another approach, or your RTRS adaptation for specific populations.</li>
                        <li>For services and support, please refer to Option 1. TPN.health will handle registration, CE, and will also provide a moderator for live virtual training.</li>
