                <h1><strong><i>Dear Trainers,<br></i></strong>We’re getting very excited to complete the launch of the RTR-Sociometrics Certificate Program. We are grateful to have
                    an incredible team of Trainers and look forward to giving you our full support. In this letter, we’d like to outline
                    opportunities for you to become highlighted as a trainer, host your own training, and leverage the optional support now
                    available to you through TPN.health. As we begin publicizing the Certificate to treatment centers and clinicians, we want
                    to ensure that you are aware of your options as Trainers.

                        manual for you to refer to. This is only for your use as a trainer, please do not share it as this would constitute a
                        copyright infringement by you as a trainer. It will be available to the students you onboard to become certificate
                        holders and should not be shown to them in advance nor to anyone else.</li>
